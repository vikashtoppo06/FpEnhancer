# FpEnhancer
This is a simple baseline for fingerprint enhancement.

We use the enhancer model of this repository‌ in [Joint Identity Verification and Pose Alignment for Partial Fingerprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03959) 

## Introduction
This is a `UNet` structured network for fingerprint enhancement. Input a fingerprint image, and the network will output the enhancement result in binary image format. Because a fully convolutional structure is used, there is no requirement for input size.


The basic block  comes from 
> Chen L, Chu X, Zhang X, et al. Simple baselines for image restoration[C]//European conference on computer vision. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022: 17-33.

The overall flowchart of our proposed algorithm is shown as follows.

</p>
<br>

We also explored the `VQVAE` form. Specifically, the codebook part is added between the original encoder and decoder, and the loss of quantization is additionally supervised.
The codebook block comes from

The overall flowchart of our new algorithm is shown as follows.

</p>
<br>

In addition, we also tried the form of `CodeFormer`. On the basis of the original `VQVAE`, a transformer is added to select the serial number of codebook. We use `VQFormer` to refer to it in the following text.

We use about `800` high-quality rolled fingerprints and binary image extracted by VeriFinger as dataset. During training, `128x128` image patches are randomly sampled from the original complete image. The image patches are then added with some random noise as augmentation. The methods and examples of augmentation can refer to 
> X. Guan, Z. Pan, J. Feng and J. Zhou, "Joint Identity Verification and Pose Alignment for Partial Fingerprints," in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, vol. 20, pp. 249-263, 2025.

Examples of image augmentation are shown as follows.

## Run
* **train Unet**
    ```shell
    python train_enhancer.py
    ```
* **train VQVAE**
    ```shell
    python train_VQenhancer.py
    ```

* **train VQFormer**
    ```shell
    python train_VQFormerEnhancer.py
    ```

* **test Unet**
    ```shell
    python inference_enhancer.py
    ```
* **test VQVAE**
    ```shell
    python inference_VQenhancer.py
    ```
* **test VQFormer**
    ```shell
    python test_VQFormerEnhancer.py
    ```

## Web App (FastAPI + FpEnhancer UI)
The `app.py` FastAPI application serves both the web interface and the enhancement API from one origin.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` (on Railway: the deployed service URL).

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `GET /` | FpEnhancer web interface (`static/index.html`) |
| `GET /health` | `{"status": "online", "service": "FpEnhancer", "device": "CPU"}` |
| `POST /enhance` | multipart/form-data, field `file` → returns enhanced `image/png` |
| `/static/*` | CSS / JS / icon assets |

Workflow: open website → upload fingerprint → **Enhance Fingerprint** → the CPU model processes it via `POST /enhance` → result appears with zoom, fullscreen and a before/after slider → download `enhanced_fingerprint.png`.

## Notice :exclamation:
Due to the fact that we only add some simple modal noise during training, there are still challenges in difficult scenarios such as latent fingerprints, highly blurry/incomplete images or complex backgrounds.
Below are examples before and after fingerprint enhancement.
